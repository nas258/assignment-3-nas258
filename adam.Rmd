## About me
- I am an M.S./Ph.D. Student in the Soil and Crops Section working under Dr. Matthew Ryan in the Sustainable Cropping Systems Lab  
- My research focuses on optimizing organic no-till corn production through utilizing cover crops, optimal nitrogen rates, effective weed management, and adequate crop density 

- Outside of research, I am a Graduate Student Coordinator for the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program that aims to increase the attainment of Ph.D. degrees by students underrepresented in academia and the professoriate.
